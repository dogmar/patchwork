## Wtf is this?

Patchwork is a content management system and blogging platform built on Git and GitHub. It's a loose collection of applications, each meant to handle its own task well.  

The current collection includes a content repository in GitHub, an indexer application, and a presentation application. The content repository holds a set of text files written in Markdown in a simple directory structure. The indexer parses the markdown files and updates a MongoDB database (and, optionally, an IndexTank API-compatible search index). The presenter is the final web server that serves the content out of the database to end-users.

## Why? Why? Whyyyyyy???

* As a Vim-user, I hate web-based text editors, and prefer a local text editor
* git provides a familiar workflow
* version controlled content
* separation of concerns
    * content
    * content management
    * presentation
