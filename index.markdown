## Wtf is this?

Patchwork content management system and blogging platform built on Git and GitHub. It's a loose collection of applications, each meant to handle its own task well.  

The current collection includes:

* a content repository in GitHub
* Thread - an application that parses the content in the content repo and updates a database and a search index
* Quilt - a presentation application that renders the final `HTML` and serves it as a web site
* Needle - a `WYSIWYG` editor to edit content

## Why? Why? Whyyyyyy???

* As a Vim-user, I hate web-based text editors, and prefer a local text editor
* git provides a familiar workflow
* version controlled content
* separation of concerns
    * content
    * content management
    * presentation
